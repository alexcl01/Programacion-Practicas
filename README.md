# Progamacion-Practica2

THIS PROGRAM IS AN UPDATED AND IMPROVED VERSION OF 'Programacion-Practica1'.
INCLUDES INHERITENCE , THE LOCALDATE CLASS, INTERNATIONALIZATION, A LOT MORE METHODS AND A TEST TO PROVE IF EVERYTHING IS GOING AS EXPECTED.

INHERITENCE: Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. The class which inherits the properties 
of other is known as subclass, and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass.
